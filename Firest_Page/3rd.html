<p>Pros
    1. Phone has glass at the back which gives it a premium look. Feels stylish to carry it along.
    2. As usual, Samsung screen is smooth. Good picture clarity.
    3. Adaptive brightness 8s one of the best I've come across till date.
    4. Phone is very light.
    5. Camera quality is also very good. Front camera is also decent.
    6. Battery life is more than 24hrs for regular browsing over 24*7 wifi connection.
    7. Fingerprint sensor on right side is handy.
    
Cons
1. Charger is only 15 Watt. 25/30 Watt would have been better.
2. Nothing else as of now.

I feel good holding and using this Phone. If there is any chance then I'll update the review
